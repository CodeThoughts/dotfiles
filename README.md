# Dmitry's Dotfiles (Ë˜â–¾Ë˜~)

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts I use for customizing my Operating System ( OS X ðŸ–¥ and Debian ðŸ’¾ ) to my preferences and setting up the software development tools I use on a daily basis.
They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.
Please note that the included setup script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in `~/dotfiles/`.

## Installation ðŸšš

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nicksp/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

- Latest `bash`
- Brew package manager (OS X only)
- Node.js
- Vim
- Postgres 9.6 with Friends (pg_bouncer, pg_tap, bg_bench, etc.)
