# Dmitry's Dotfiles (˘▾˘~)

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts I use for customizing my Operating System ( OS X 🖥 and Debian 💾 ) to my preferences and setting up the software development tools I use on a daily basis.
They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.
Please note that the included setup script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in `~/dotfiles/`.

## Installation 🚚

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nicksp/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

## Yay! What comes with the package? 📦
- Latest `bash`
- Brew package manager (OS X only)
- Node.js
- Vim
- Postgres 9.6 with Friends (pg_bouncer, pg_tap, bg_bench, etc.)
- RabbitMQ
- `tmux` – Awesome terminal multiplexer, so you don't need tabs when you have persisted sessions. Hence, no slow iTerm anymore.
- `curl` – Bring me something out of there
- `tree` – Print tree graph of a directory
- `mutt` – Mail client that works
- `htop`, `iotop`, `strace`, `multitail` and `lsof` – Investigation tools
- `tpp` – Your amazing pitch
