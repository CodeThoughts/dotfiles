# Dmitry's Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts I use for customizing my Operating System (OS X, Debian) to my preferences and setting up the software development tools I use on a daily basis.
They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.
Please note that the included setup script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in `~/dotfiles/`.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nicksp/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```
